<h2>This React App allows you to save holiday locations of your choice. I built this using React JS and Tailwind CSS for the front end and Firebase for the backend.
    Each user can save and delete their own destinations which can be viewed later. As I created this in 2 days, there are still more features which I would like to add</h2>
<h1>Future Features:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Connect to 'Weather Check' App for weather data</li>
  <li>Add Info For All Locations</li>
  <li>Connect Flight Booking API To Allow Users To Book Flights With Stripe</li>
  <li>Let Users Share Saved Locations On Social Media</li>
</ul>
