<h2>I designed this React App completely from scratch. This App allows you to save holiday locations of your choice. I built this using React JS and Tailwind CSS for the front end and Firebase for the backend.
    The API that is storing the images and data of the locations was built by myself in Python - Flask (As a result, there are not many locations). Each user can save and delete their own destinations which can be viewed later. As I created this in 2 days, there are still more features which I would like to add</h2>
<h1>Future Features:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Connect to 'Weather Check' App for weather data</li>
  <li>Add Info For All Locations</li>
  <li>Connect Flight Booking API To Allow Users To Book Flights With Stripe</li>
  <li>Let Users Share Saved Locations On Social Media</li>
  <li>Publicly Host Site</li>
  <li>Add More Locations To My Flask API</li>
</ul>
<h2>As Of Now, This Is Using Localhost As I Built My Own Custom API. I may publicly host the API using ngrok to allow others to visit it.</h2>
